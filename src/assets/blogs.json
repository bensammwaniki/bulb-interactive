      "content": " It was just like any other day for the Maasai community residing in the Kibera neighborhood. Most of these people, living in small Manyattas, came to the city in search of pastures for their animals, all the way from the neighboring Kajiado County. They graze their cows in the nearby Ngong forest and any other places where they can find grass around Nairobi, including alongside roads. Unfortunately, their homeland had been gripped by a relentless drought, leaving them without sustenance and no choice but to seek refuge in the city. However, the County Government of Nairobi recently declared their stance against keeping animals within the urban landscape, citing the livestock as a public nuisance.On the morning of June 14, 2023, the Maasai community awoke to a startling surprise. Police vehicles flooded their Manyatta compound, accompanied by officers prepared to forcefully evict their beloved cows from the city. What followed was a tense confrontation, with words clashing between the Maasai and the police. Yet, the herders had nowhere to relocate their precious herds. As tensions escalated, the police resorted to drastic measures, arresting the Maasai people, including women and children, who were swiftly confined to crowded and oppressive police cells. Within those dismal cells, Dorcas Daddy, a strong and resilient woman, shared her harrowing tale of enduring the unbearable plight of being detained with her six-month-old baby. Their desperate cries for sustenance went unanswered as they languished without food or water, their bodies and souls yearning for even a glimmer of hope. She held her frail baby close, waiting anxiously. Charity, another survivor of police brutality, bore the physical and emotional scars of her encounter. I stood there with my young son as the police approached, she recounted with a trembling voice. Without warning, the area chief violently attacked us, his hand striking my cheek with force. My defenseless child became a victim of their cruelty, subjected to a beating. She, too, spent more than 10 hours in the cell with her young battered boy. At WKW organization, we encounter various emergencies, ranging from food crises to medical issues, fires, floods, theft, violence, and other forms of crises. And now, we found ourselves confronted with this new emergency. Most of these parents are our beneficiaries. The arrested parents had nobody to call for help except us. We promptly extended our support to these women and their children suffering in the confines of the police cells. WKW took the necessary steps to secure their release by bailing them out. This spared them from spending the cold night in the cells without food or water, ensuring they didn't have to endure the pain of empty stomachs. Nevertheless, at WKW, we remain steadfast in our commitment to supporting these brave women and their families. We continue to provide assistance, advocate for their rights, and strive to create a more inclusive and just society where no one's basic needs are neglected or violated. As part of our efforts, we are actively supporting Charity in obtaining a P3 form to report the case of her mistreatment by the chief, and we fervently hope that justice will prevail.
